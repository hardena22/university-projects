Code for projects completed in my certificate program in Data Science &amp; Business Analytics, delivered by Great Learning through the University of Texas at Austin.

The files included in this repository are the code for the projects I completed while pursuing a data science certificate from UT Austin. There are 7 projects included, and the file titles signify the class topic and the name of the case we were studying.

The course had two options for project completion, full code and low code, where full code meant you built the code nearly from scratch and low code was meant more as a code completion with a presentation attached. For each project I completed the full code version.
